# Nokia recruitment tasks repo
it's my repo for C++ tasks from Nokia company

not sure if i can share exact task but briefly:
#1: program counts words in sentences and returns number of words in longest sentence;
#2: program counts steps in varriation of Collatz conjecture problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)
#3: program counts merging list problem with constraints


it's just my approach, not sure if they are bestest or even correct
